Hi, I'm Théo Danielou.  
I'm currently studying for a Master 2 in MVA at the Ecole Normale Supérieure of Paris-Saclay, and I'm also finishing my engineering course at Telecom SudParis.  
I'm interested in the various applications of computer vision and in particular applications combining medical imaging and machine learning.    
I'm currently looking for a 6-month work placement in these areas.   
On this github, you will find some of the projects I have worked on during my studies.
